Except for calls to the `/auth/login` and `/health` endpoints, all Cribl API requests require you to authenticate with a Bearer token. In Cribl, Bearer tokens are [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519).

You must include a valid Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests. The Bearer token verifies your identity and ensures secure access to the requested resources. The process for retrieving the Bearer token depends on whether you authenticate on [Cribl.Cloud and hybrid](#api-auth-cloud) deployments or in [on-prem](#api-auth-on-prem) deployments.



- In Cribl.Cloud and hybrid deployments, Bearer tokens are valid for `24` hours.

- In on-prem deployments, Bearer tokens expire according to the value you provide for the **Auth token TTL** setting at **Settings** > **Global** > **General Settings** > **API Server Settings** > **Advanced**. The default setting is `3600` seconds (`1` hour).

Your are responsible for ensuring that your applications obtain a new Bearer token within the expiration window for each token.



> For on-prem deployments, if you're using SSO/OpenID Connect Authentication, you must toggle on **Allow login as Local User** in Cribl (see [Set Up Fallback Access](/iam/sso-on-prem/#fallback-access-on-prem)). You'll need to be a Local user when you authenticate.
>
> To use `https` for on-prem requests, you must [configure Transport Layer Security (TLS)](/stream/securing-tls/). If you do not configure TLS, use `http` instead. Use `http` only for testing in development environments. In production, configure TLS and use `https` to secure your communications.

## Authenticate in Cribl.Cloud and Hybrid Deployments {#api-auth-cloud}

To authenticate for API requests to [control plane](/cribl-as-code/api-reference/control-plane/cribl-core) (Cribl.Cloud or hybrid) or [management plane](/cribl-as-code/api-reference/management-plane/workspaces) (Cribl.Cloud) endpoints, first create an API Credential. The API Credential provides a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Provide these in a request to `https://login.cribl.cloud/oauth/token` to obtain a 24-hour Bearer token to authenticate subsequent API requests.

The authentication process is the same for [control plane](/cribl-as-code/api-reference/control-plane/cribl-core) and [management plane](/cribl-as-code/api-reference/management-plane/workspaces) requests. The only difference is the [base URL](api#base-urls) and endpoint you use for your API requests.

> On Cribl.Cloud Government, authentication requests use a different URL and request format. Log in to Cribl.Cloud Government to get a customized example of the authentication request. 
> To open a Help drawer that displays the example, navigate to **Products > Cribl > Organization > API Credentials** and select the tooltip icon next to **Add Credential**.

{.box .cloud}



To create an API Credential:

1. Log in to Cribl.Cloud as an Owner or an Admin.
1. On the top bar, select **Products**, and then select **Cribl**.
1. In the sidebar, select **Organization**, and then select **API Credentials**.
1. Select **Add Credential**.
1. Enter a **Name** and an optional **Description**.
1. In the **Organization Permissions** drop-down menu, select a Role to use for defining [Permissions](/iam/permissions#organization) for the Credential's tokens.

    The **Organization Permissions** selector is available on [certain plan/license tiers](https://cribl.io/pricing/). Without a proper license, all tokens are granted the Admin Role.

    - If you choose the **User** Role, under **Workspace Access**, define the desired [Permissions](/iam/permissions#workspace) for specific [Workspaces](/stream/workspaces).
    
    - Choosing the **Admin** or **Owner** Role automatically grants admin access to all Workspaces.

1. Select **Save**.

The **API Credentials** page displays the new API Credential within a few seconds.

The API Credential includes a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret** that Organization Owners and Admins can use to generate Bearer tokens. Organization Owners and Admins can view, edit, and disable existing API Credentials. Only Owners can delete API Credentials.

The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are sensitive information and should be kept private.

![API Credentials with Client ID and Client Secret](cloud-api-credential-and-token-4.9.png)
{scale="90%" border="true"}

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, provide them in the body of a request to `https://login.cribl.cloud/oauth/token`:

{{% tabs "apiCloudAuthObtainToken" "apiCloudAuthObtainToken" "Authentication Request Example (Cribl.Cloud and Hybrid)" %}}
{{% tab-item "apiCloudAuthObtainToken" %}}

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://login.cribl.cloud/oauth/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "client_id": "${clientId}",
  "client_secret": "${clientSecret}",
  "audience": "https://api.cribl.cloud"
}'
```

{{% /tab-item %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

As shown in the following example response, the JSON object in the response includes several attributes:

- `access_token`: The Bearer token to use in the `Authorization` header for authentication in subsequent API requests.
- `scope`: The [Permissions](/iam/permissions) that the Bearer token grants.
- `expires_in`: The number of seconds until the Bearer token expires. In Cribl.Cloud/hybrid, Bearer tokens expire `24` hours (`86400` seconds) after they are created. You are responsible for ensuring that your applications obtain a new Bearer token within the expiration window for each token.
- `token_type`: The type of the token. in Cribl.Cloud/hybrid, the value is always `Bearer`. 

{{% tabs "apiCloudAuthResponse" "apiCloudAuthResponse" "Authentication Response Example (Cribl.Cloud/Hybrid)" %}}
{{% tab-item "apiCloudAuthResponse" %}}

```json
{
  "access_token": "abcdefg1234567890...exampleBearerToken",
  "scope": "user:read:workergroups user:update:workergroups user:read:connections user:update:connections user:update:workspaces user:read:workspaces",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```
{{% /tab-item %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

To use the Bearer token in subsequent API requests, include it in the `Authorization` header as shown in this control plane example:

{{% tabs "apiCloudTokenExample" "apiCloudTokenExample" "API Request Example (Cribl.Cloud and Hybrid)" %}}
{{% tab-item "apiCloudTokenExample" %}}

```shell
curl -X GET 'https://${workspaceName}-${organizationId}.cribl.cloud/api/v1/system/inputs' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer abcdefg1234567890...exampleBearerToken' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
{{% /tab-item %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

## Authenticate in On-Prem Deployments {#api-auth-on-prem}

To authenticate using the API in on-prem deployments, send a request to the `/auth/login` endpoint. The response includes the Bearer token required for subsequent API requests.

The following example request demonstrates an `/auth/login` request. Replace the variables in the example request with your hostname, port, and login credentials (username and password). Your username and password are sensitive information and should be kept private.

{{% tabs "apiCustAuthObtainToken" "apiCustAuthObtainToken" "Authentication Request Example (On-Prem Deployment)" %}} {{% tab-item "apiCustAuthObtainToken" %}}
```shell
curl -X POST 'https://${hostname}:${port}/api/v1/auth/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "username": "${username}",
  "password": "${password}"
}'
```
{{% /tab-item %}} {{% /tabs %}}

The response is a JSON object like the following example. The value of the `token` attribute in the response is the Bearer token:

{{% tabs "apiCustAuthResponse" "apiCustAuthResponse" "Authentication Response Example (On-Prem Deployment)" %}} {{% tab-item "apiCustAuthResponse" %}}
```json
{
  "token": "Bearer abcdefg1234567890...exampleBearerToken",
  "forcePasswordChange": false
}
```
{{% /tab-item %}} {{% /tabs %}}

To use the Bearer token in subsequent API requests, include it in the `Authorization` header, like this:

{{% tabs "apiCustTokenExample" "apiCustTokenExample" "API Request Example (On-Prem Deployment)" %}}
{{% tab-item "apiCustTokenExample" %}}

```shell
curl -X GET 'https://${hostname}:${port}/api/v1/system/inputs' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer Bearer abcdefg1234567890...exampleBearerToken' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Authenticate and Create HEC Tokens with Python {#hec-tokens}

Cribl Solutions Engineering developed an example script that demonstrates how use Python to authenticate to the Cribl API, make a simple POST request, and add a new HEC token. The script and instructions for usage are available in the [`py_hec_token_mgr` GitHub repo](https://github.com/camrunr/py_hec_token_mgr).

To use the script, you'll need: 

- Python 3.
- The Python 3 Requests module (use brew or pip3 to install).
- A working, distributed Cribl Stream or Edge installation, with a configured [Splunk HEC Source](/stream/sources-splunk-hec).
- An admin username and password.
